# The Theory

<Divider />

The _Sekhmet Hypothesis_ attempts to explain cyclical changes in popular culture through 11 year cycles in the sun.

The theory goes that every 11 years, the sun shifts and triggers cultural change. The four different phases of culture, known as “life scripts” are:

- **Friendly Weakness** - I'm not okay, you're okay
- **Hostile Weakness** - I'm not okay, you're not okay
- **Friendly Strength** - I'm okay, you're okay
- **Hostile Strength** - I'm okay, you're not okay

Each life script is characterized by an "I" and a "you," focusing on how the individual sees itself contextualized within its environment.

None of this is based in actual science, especially the sun stuff, but it’s fun to pretend that it matters. I often think about how these four life scripts apply to the overall cultural zeitgeist, the media we consume, the personalities of people we know, and the phases of our own lives. The turning over of a sun cycle theoretically causes changes in how people wear their hair, how they wear their clothes, etc.

The current sun cycle began December 21st, 2012 cause duh when else would it have begun. Due to the thinning of the ozone layer and the internet, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to determine which life script phase just ended and which one is coming next. By dissecting some of the media and the people around us, perhaps we’ll be able to get a better perspective.

The goal is to pick a person, place, or thing and attempt to choose which life script that thing embodies, then give a short explanation.
